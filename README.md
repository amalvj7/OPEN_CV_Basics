OpenCV Basics Project
Introduction
This project showcases the foundational techniques in OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. The focus is on image and video processing, with practical implementations of various operations that are essential for understanding and utilizing OpenCV in real-world scenarios.

Features
Image & Video Capture: Capture images and videos from your system's webcam.
Webcam Integration: Real-time video processing with webcam feed.
Color Splitting & Detection: Split image colors into channels and detect specific colors.
Color Change: Modify the color space of images (e.g., BGR to HSV).
Image Blurring: Apply Gaussian blur and other blurring techniques.
Edge Detection: Use Canny edge detection to highlight image contours.
Resizing & Cropping: Change image dimensions and crop specific areas.
Drawing Shapes: Draw rectangles, circles, and other shapes on images.
Adding Text: Overlay text onto images with custom font and size.
Perspective Warping: Transform the perspective of images (e.g., warp to top-down view).
JPEG Handling: Load, process, and save images in JPEG format.
Shape Detection: Detect basic shapes like triangles, squares, and circles in images.
Face Detection: Identify faces in images using pre-trained models.
